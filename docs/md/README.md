## FSL_USER_REF.md

At present the FSL_USER_REF.md serves as both the language specification and the user reference. The user ref should be used at present.

## Planned documentation organization:
```
FSL_LANGUAGE_SPECIFICATION.md  Formal definition of language behavior
FSL_USER_GUIDE.md              Oriented toward use, examples, discussion of internals impacting using FSL to describe transforms
FSL_API_USER_GUIDE.md          More verbose explanation of the FSL API than is available in doxygen
FSL_APPLICATION_GUIDE.md       Documentation of use cases for common benchmarks and applications
```

The long term intent will split current FSL\_USER\_REF.md and add an API discussion document to augment the doxygen and an application guide.
